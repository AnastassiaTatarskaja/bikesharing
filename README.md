## Summary:

According to the analysis, male subscribers comprise majority of bike sharing customers whose peak hours of rent fall on a Thursday evening. In addition, since the highest number of bike rentals are male subscribers who use bikes for an average of five minutes and stay in close proximity to hotels and tourist destinations, we can conclude that starting points for the bike sharing locations should be near hotels and tourist destinations in Des Moines. Since Thursday is the highest rate of bike sharing, company needs to ensure that maximum number of bikes are available in the evening between 5PM and 6PM. Finally, company should work on developing a plan to attract female customers and families. One suggestion is working with hotels and the city to organize short family bike trips around most popular tourist destinations, as well as parks or rivers. 

Additional visualizations that will help further improve the business are maps of customer locations based on cell phone traffic and heat maps of age groups. Cell phone traffic will help identify times and locations of the most concentration of people during the week. It will help identify additional locations for bike sharing. Heat maps by age group will help identify target groups and possibly marketing strategy to target groups that were missed during the initial launch.
